      <font size=50px; face="Pinyon Script";><b>C</b></font>oronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It has since spread
      worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:30px;"><font size=50px; face="Pinyon Script";><b>S</b></font>ymptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. Around one in five
      infected individuals do not develop any symptoms. While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS can be precipitated by cytokine storms, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood
      clots. Longer-term damage to organs (in particular, the lungs and heart) has been observed.</p>
     <p style="font-size:30px;"><font size=50px; face="Pinyon Script";><b>T</b></font>here is concern about a significant number of patients who have recovered from the acute phase of the disease but continue to experience a range of
      effects—known as long COVID—for months afterwards. These effects include severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issues, low-grade fever, muscle weakness, and breathlessness. </p>

        <h1 style="font-size:80px; display:inline-block; font-family: 'Redressed', cursive;">Prevention</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="prevention" >
    <p style="font-size:30px;"><font size=50px; face="Pinyon Script";><b>P</b></font>reventive measures include physical or social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions. Several vaccines have been developed and various countries have initiated mass vaccination campaigns.
Although work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is currently symptomatic. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.

  <div class="trans">
    <p  style="font-size:30px;"><font size=50px; face="Pinyon Script";><b>C</b></font>OVID-19 spreads from person to person mainly through the respiratory route after an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks or breathes. A new infection occurs when virus-containing particles exhaled by an infected person, either respiratory droplets or aerosols, get into the mouth, nose, or eyes of other people who are in close contact with the infected person. During human-to-human transmission, an average 1000 infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection.</p>
    <p style="font-size:30px;"><font size=50px; face="Pinyon Script";><b>T</b></font>he closer people interact, and the longer they interact, the more likely they are to transmit COVID-19. Closer distances can involve larger droplets (which fall to the ground) and aerosols, whereas longer distances only involve aerosols. The larger droplets may also evaporate into the aerosols (known as droplet nuclei). The relative importance of the larger droplets and the aerosols is not clear as of November 2020, however the virus is not known to transmit between rooms over long distances such as through air ducts. </p>
    <p style="font-size:30px;"><font size=50px; face="Pinyon Script";><b>A</b></font>irborne transmission is able to particularly occur indoors, in high risk locations, such as in restaurants, choirs, gyms, nightclubs, offices, and religious venues, often when they are crowded or less ventilated. It also occurs in healthcare settings, often when aerosol-generating medical procedures are performed on COVID-19 patients.</p>

  <p style="font-size:30px;"><font size=50px; face="Pinyon Script";><b>S</b></font>evere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.[40] It is thought to have an animal (zoonotic) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13). </p>
