      <h3>Steps to Follow to Self-Treat Covid at Home</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Getting plenty of rest.</strong> While fighting a new virus, expect your body to be busy. By giving yourself plenty of time to rest, you'll help provide your body with the energy it needs to get the job done.</li>
      <li><strong>Drinking plenty of water.</strong> Making sure you're adequately hydrated can help alleviate several symptoms. Fevers are usually accompanied by increased sweating, and drinking lots of water can help replenish the extra water you're losing — preventing dehydration. If you have a dry cough, a teaspoon of honey in hot water can help soothe your throat. If you have congestion, a warm, non-caffeinated beverage can help loosen mucus. In addition, ensuring you stay well-hydrated can aid your immune system as it fights off the virus.</li>
      <li><strong>Using over-the-counter medications when necessary.</strong> If you have a high fever, you can take a fever reducer, such as acetaminophen, to help bring it down. If you have body aches, a sore throat or severe cough, a pain reliever can help lessen the discomfort these symptoms can bring. Just be sure to follow the dosage recommendations on the bottle and don't take any medications that may conflict with any other medications you're taking or any health conditions you may have.</li>

      <h3>Treatment Protocol at Hospitals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Check the levels of oxygen in your blood with a clip-on finger monitor</li>
        <li>Listen to your lungs</li>
        <li>Give you a COVID-19 test. This involves putting a 6-inch cotton swab up both sides of your nose for about 15 seconds.</li>
        <li>Give you a chest X-ray or CT scan</li>
      </ul>
      <br><p align="center" style="font-size:25px;">You may get extra oxygen through two small tubes that go just inside your nostrils. In very serious cases, doctors will connect you to a machine that can breathe for you, called a ventilator.</p>
<p align="center" style="font-size:25px; font-family:'Philosopher', sans-serif;">You may also get fluids through a tube, or IV, in your arm to keep you from getting dehydrated. Doctors will also closely monitor your breathing. The goal is for your infection to run its course and for your lungs to heal enough that they can breathe on their own again.</p>
<p align="center" style="font-size:25px;">Your doctors may give you an antiviral medicine called remdesivir (Veklury) Remdesivir is the first drug arpproved by the FDA for treatment of hospitalized COVID patients over the age of 12. Research shows that some patients recover faster after taking it. Remdesivir was created to fight Ebola, but the FDA has issued an emergency use ruling so doctors can use it against COVID-19.
